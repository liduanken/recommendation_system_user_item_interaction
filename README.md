# Recommendation System for Movie Recommendation
## Introduction
This project introduces a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with content-based techniques. Using item features and an open-source LLM, dense semantic embeddings from metadata (descriptions, categories, tags) enhance recommendations. Integrating these embeddings with user-item interactions boosts personalization, especially for cold-start items or those with limited history. This approach leverages new infrastructure and tools for better recommendations.
